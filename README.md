Project: Travelling Salesman Problem
A traveller needs to visit all the cities from a list, where distances between all the cities are known and 
each city should be visited just once. What is the shortest possible route that he visits each city exactly 
once and returns to the origin city? Given a set of cities and the cost of travel (or distance) between 
each possible pair, you have to find the best possible way of visiting all the cities and returning to the 
starting point that minimizes the travel cost (or travel distance). Consider the following set of cities:
The problem lies in finding a minimal path passing from all vertices once. For example, the path 
Path1 {A, B, C, D, E, A} and the path Path2 {A, B, C, E, D, A} pass all the vertices but Path1 has a 
total length of 24 and Path2 has a total length of 31.
In this project, you have to write a conde in C/C++ that solves the travelling salesman problem and 
shows the best path along with the minimal cost. You should use Dynamic Programming or a 
recursive algorithm based on Backtracking approach in this regard as they have the ability to give 
same result in far fewer attempts than Brute Force method trials and thus handles the complexity 
better.
